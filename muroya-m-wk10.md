##Learning DITA

As far as the techincal aspect of DITA goes, the only thing that will definitely take some time getting used to is learning all of the very specific semantic XML tags. For example, the whole hierarchy of `<steps>`, `<steps>`, `<cmd>` is something that takes some careful attention. It's kind of like learning the names of a bunch of new HTML elements selectors in a way.

The more challenging aspect of writing with DITA, I think, is developing appropriate, self-contained topic models. Creating a task, concept, or reference that is independent of the other information that a user may need requires some reconsideration of the actual goals of each section of the content, rather than the overall document itself. It's also a good exercise in writing, concise, pointed pieces that get to the goal quickly and don't add unnecessary information. That stuff can go in a seperate topic.

##Historicizing Revision

Larger revision goals:

* Rechunk information and revise section titles
* re-implement inline notes across all of content
* weave analysis and reading sections together; use more of stop-and-go structure rather than info --> analysis
* correct citations 

Will revisit for timeline soon
