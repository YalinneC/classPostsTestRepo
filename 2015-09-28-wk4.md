##Bootstrap CSS Framework
I already know a fair bit about HTML and CSS, and have been experimenting with styles and different "tricks" you can do with them. However, I'd never tried using a full-fledged framework like Bootstrap—only small pieces of CSS tools for things like navigation bars or simply grid systems.

I chose to use Bootstrap over Pure.CSS not because I disliked Pure.CSS but because 1) I have heard of it before (a friend recommended I check it out for mobile-responsive CSS a while back) and 2) after some brief research I found that it is developed and maintained by a few former Twitter employees. I'm a fan of Twitter, so I thought I'd give it a try.

*As a bit of a side note, I do like how it's hosted externally so I can just link to it in HTML file without having to keep in my directory. Not sure what the page load implications of this are, but convenient and probably negligible practical effect on my little static page, if any.*

When first using bootstrap, I was overwhelmed by the amount of options and possibilities available. A "framework" is a lot more than I thought it would be: it's a layout system, a set of pre-made CSS toolkits, even a basic theme you can use to create the visual design of your pages. I enjoyed toying around with all the different classes and styles available, but the thing I found of most interest was the grid row-column system.

The grid is pretty cool and logical: you set up however many "rows" of page content you need, and within each row there are 12 equally spaced blocks over which you can lay "columns" of various block-width. This allows different width ratios for columns on a page: one 12-block col, two 6-block cols (each half the page width), one 3-block col and a 9-block col (1:3 ratio), and so on. It makes a lot of sense.

The cool part is where you define breakpoints; at different screen widths (pre-determined pixel widths), you can "break" the columns so that they resize. For example, if you have a two-column 1:1 row, you can break it at "medium" width so that when the viewport on the device being used to see your content is "medium" or smaller (like a tablet, phone, or small browser window), it will resize so that each column becomes its own full-width row. Cool "hack-y" way of setting up your grid. [I tried it out on my bio assignment](https://github.com/mattmuroya/bio-framework-bootstrap).

##"More than a technical, generalizable skill"
When my friends ask me how I do something or how to begin learning—web design, graphic design, video editing, audio recording/editing—I always tell them to *have a goal in mind, and a picture of what you want. Learning by doing it, don't do it by learning it.* Obviously, learning a skill is more complex than that, but the idea is that reaching your goal and practicing and developing the skills along the way becomes so much more attainable, practical, effective, and *enjoyable* when you actually know what that goal is and its context

While it's good to have a base knowledge of some skill or tool as a start, these tools (like writing and web-design with HTML and CSS) are so much more as a "recurrent, goal-directed sequence of activities." You can't just write or use technology and expect it to magically attain meaning or significance; you've got to know the context of what you're doing, why you're doing it, what you're trying to achieve. As stated by Scribner & Cole, "Cognitive skills, no less than perceptual or motor or linguistic skills, are intimately bound up with the nature of practices that require them."

I think this applies to the practice of web coding/design as well. While you could go in and watch a set of YouTube tututorials on how to use Bootstrap (which I did), it becomes meaningful and relevant only when you know *why* you're there and what you're trying to do. For this assignment, it was easier to figure out the framework and focus on what was important (the grid system over nav bars or forms or whatever other styles) and how to implement them. If the assignment had been "go learn how to use Bootstrap" vs "create a bio page, using Bootstrap to achieve what you need," it would have been much more difficult to attain results; thus, you don't get the critical error and visual feedback that you need in order to learn. Plus, if you just "go learn Bootstrap," you don't have the practical experience of applying it to actually *do* anything.

It's important to have knowledge of the practice, the context, *and* the required skills to create effective, meaningful writing and communication.
