##Social Dynamics, or Scientific Truth, or Sheer Human Cussedness: Design Decisions in the Evolution of a User Interface
*Haas, Christina*

*"My major claim in this chapter is that computers, computer systems, and computer features have a history." --Haas, 143*

Computer technologies (and writing technologies in general) are, by nature, material conventions and therefore are the product of social constructs and human design decisions. To understand computers as writing tools and their designs, we must see them as tools with *histories*; that is, they are built upon layers of other writing technologies (alphabets, writing and logic systems, even the physical manifestations of writing) and they are the product of conscious human design decisions (139). This follows the Vygotskian assertion that tools and technologies are not *created*, but rather culturally and socially "appropriated" (138) and evolved. Those features or even entire systems that seem "natural" in design did not come about uncontested and without debate; this idea prevents critical analysis of the tools in question. These features and systems, critical to users, have a winding history. Two such critical features—the scroll bar and sets of menus as implemented with the Andrew Project—are given as examples.

The Andrew Project was a collaborative initiative of the Information Technology Center (ITC) at Carnegie Mellon to develop an education computing system at CMU. Haas served as a consultant on the project, and recollects her experience with the teams involved to demonstrate, through the examples of the scroll bar and menus, that computer systems and features do indeed have a history. She also notes (and I find it quite interesting) that the version of this history that she presents here does not necessarily have to be *the* history, or the "correct" history, to prove her point.

*Side note: really interesting little section on the "user advocates" in the UIG on page 145. Seems like this group is responsible for what a lot of technical writers ad usability specialists do for tech companies today. It's interesting to read about how poorly regarded these people were and just how "low on the totem pole" they came, whereas now there is a whole profession dedicated to UX/UI and usability. It's an entire field of study. Crazy how things change. Just a cool little observation.*

###The Scroll Bar Wars
When the Andrew interface was in development, most of the people on the team didn't think much of the way in which the scroll bar was implemented: two main methods of navigation (thumbing and scrolling) for large and fine document scrubbing. It was what it was, it worked, and it worked "basically fine" (151). However, the User Interface Group (UIG) was adamant about revising it; they found it was difficult to teach users unfamiliar with the system. The UIG proposed three new versions of the scroll bar, and when it was heard that the ITC would be implementing a new version, a "scroll bar war" broke out; many different versions and alterations and "takes" on the scroll bar were circulated with minor differences. Many people didn't take this too seriously, because they believed that the Andrew interface would allow for customization. It was an important pillar of their idea of design that "advanced users" would be able to customize their interface. However, it was the singular design decision of one team member that threw out all other iterations and implemented what would become the final version of the scroll bar. His single decision dictated the evolution of such a prominent feature.

###Flipping the Bird
Like the scroll bar, another feature in hot debate was the menu system. However, in contrast with the scroll bar, the evolution of the menu system had a much slower turnaround. The hierarchical system had no glaring "faults" and it seemed to be more of an issue of refining rather than defining; so much so that one of the few "issues" Haas references is the visual design of the hand used to point out menu items: it looked like it was flipping the bird. The "problems" with the menu system stemmed from issues of constraint—technically and logically. With no formal hierarchy or set system, menus could become unwieldy and take up too much space, or become confusing to the user. Issues of design (right to left vs left to right) seemed secondary and more based on preference than scientific dis/advantages. Elementary user focus group testing even revealed that consistency (of style, naming, functionality) was more important than presentation and implementation styles. The final decision on presentation was made, again, by a single team member. Though he claimed his decision was swayed by scientific findings (slight preference to left-stacking menus), it was really up to personal decision. *This leads to an interesting question of what might have happened had he preferred the right-stacking menus; with no scientific findings to "back up" his decision, would he have still chosen based on preference? Or did social pressure from his colleagues sway his decsion? It's another illustration of Vygotsky's idea that all things are constructs of social and cultural context.*

Through these two examples, Haas seeks to "open the black box" of technology and mystify it to an extent; to rid readers of their understanding of transparent history of technology (163). Competing design decsions are not ultimately decided by which one is "best," but rather by the cultural and social context and issues of "power and politics, matters of timeing and cost, and rival theories about sofware design" (163). Consider the lowly UIG: barely even given the time of day on their own, but when word got out that their idea for a new scroll bar was being considered, everyone everywhere jumped on the bandwagon and turned it into full-on frenzy.

Technology is not "transparent" or fixed; but that does not make it any less powerful or certain; it only opens up the black box to questioning, criticism, scrutiny, and analysis.

##HTML 5

Remember when cars had cassette decks? Yours might *still* have one. Back when cassettes were the standard for music distribution, it made sense that cars would pack cassette decks. Jump ahead a few years, and the music industry begins to shift to CDs. While this was great, it posed a set of problems: people didn't have CD players in their cars! The music industry was changing and evolving much faster than people were buying new cars. Even though CDs were technicaly and practically "superior" (subjectively... Haas, anyone?) to cassettes, people weren't about to upgrade their cars just to support a new feature. Their cars worked for what they needed them for, and it fit into their daily routine just fine. However, car manufacturers saw the shift and began to build CD players into their cars, and eventually cassette decks when out the window.

Fast forward again to the age of digital music: enter the iPod. When digital music distribution became the norm, no one had aux jacks in their cars. In order to get the iPod to work with your car, a bunch of third parties made little devices to "hack" the existing cassette decks in many cars into working with iPods; I'm sure everyone in this class has either seen or used one of those little cassette things that plugs into your headphone jack. It was a way of using new technology in an old system, assuming that system had support for a cassette deck. Today, everything is moving toward bluetooth and cloud-based music distribution; again, a feature that most cars out there can't yet support.

I think it's a similar story with browsers and new HTML elements. A lot of browsers out there work just fine for most people and do what they need them to do; however, they don't support all the latest features that developers are using to build web pages and apps. So developers are using these new standards, and there's a bevy of devs working to create "hacks" to get this tech to work, similar to those plug-in cassette adapters or FM/bluetooth transmitters. These hacks include things like HTML 5 shiv (Duckett) and other javascripts to give these older browsers the features to support the new HTML 5 elements. HTML Boilerplate, for example, incorporates normalize.css and modernizr. These two tools are used to synchronize browsers experiences and ensure that older browsers (be they outdated or just of different feature sets) can properly handle the newest HTML elements on a page.

##Historicizing Pitch

I'm fairly certain I'd like to historicize the `@media` CSS rule, or "media queries." Media queries are an important standard for modern responsive web design used to tell a web page about a brower's window properies (size/width) or the device on which it's being viewed in order to apply specific CSS rules. I might be interested in exploring the viewport meta tag or relative sizing (%s or relative font sizing) but media queries are much more standardized and have a richer history (though it wasn't named and wasn't called "media queries," a basic implementation of this idea was [proposed way back in 1994](http://www.w3.org/People/howcome/p/cascade.html) with the initial idea of cascading style sheets!).

###What practices are linked to this technology: tools, community knowledge and values, & skills?
Obviously, the main application of media queries is in responsive web design. As a relatively new web practice (though I'd argue that all web practices are "relatively" new in the grand scheme of writing and media), responsive design is becoming increasingly important not only as an issue of site traffic (lots more people coming in through mobile), but also one of SEO and standards compliance (google prefers sites that it deems "mobile-friendly") and also that of accessibility (studies have shown that there are [a LOT of people](http://karenmcgrane.com/2014/01/13/the-mobile-content-mandate/) for whom mobile internet access is the ONLY form of internet access at home). I'd like to investigate media queries, a way of the developer meeting users where *they* are coming from and what devices *they* are using, as a major componenet to the mobile web and responsive design-minded content delivery.

###What competing issues or trends are you interested in investigating in more detail? Why?
There's a whole debate on the importance of content vs design in mobile-first web delivery. Should content come first? Should design and structure come first? Should we restructure based on mobile vs desktop viewership? I'm interested in learning more about *how* media queries are being used: hiding/showing content? Resizing content? Loading different CSS files altogether at different device or viewport widths? There's a lot out there about how mobile viewership is being treated and what the designers and writers serve based on the mediational means of users/readers/viewers. For example, the twitter desktop website is stilll not fully responsive; you get a different site, design, and layout when you access it from your phone. I think this is extremely interesting and it makes me wonder how different designers and devlopers are using web different web technologies to reach audiences through different mediums—and what the strategic implications are for these different methods.
