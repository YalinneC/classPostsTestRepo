#Week 2 Responses

##Summaries:

###The Science of Handwriting
*Keim, Brandon*

As society moves toward fully digital content delivery, writing by hand becomes more and more obsolete. However, there are still important cognitive and developmental implications of handwriting—extensive studies (in addition to the "soft" scientific anecdotal experiences of Keim and some of the authors referenced) have shown that retention and recall is improved by handwriting. This includes both the visual geometry of letterforms as well as verbal information. The constructive and visual feedback of handwriting also exercises coordination the hand, eye, and mind. Our hands are important communicative delivery tools; handwriting stimulates important motor activity in the brain that keyboarding does not. Keim argues that handwriting creates the "building blocks for sturdier mental architectures."

###On the Relationship Between Old and New Technologies
*Haas, Christina*

In today's cultural systems, there is an oversimplified view of "technology," wherein communication and information delivery is (incorrectly) categorized into two camps: that which is decidedly "untechnological" (books, print, other written communication) and that which is "technological" (digitized communication, computers). Haas points out that many modern users do not even consider that “old” technologies are even technologies at all (such as print material or typewriters) because they have a longer history or have evolved into other technologies (websites and computers). This, according to Haas, is not the case, as “older” technologies are still technologies just as much as their newer counterparts. She cites Vygotsky's notion of technological mediation which affirms that changing technologies are not simply a linear progression of tech because tech is so closely tied to individual and cultural social practice. Haas' main statement is that: there is a divided concept of technology in the workplace, there are many different forms of technologies in effect in the workplace, and "advanced" technologies are not necessarily the most powerful ones. Haas draws on the ideas of contingency and constraint from Bijker's *theory of sociotechnical change* to understand the both constant and changing nature of technology as it related to different societal viewpoints.

###`<table>`ing the Grid
*Dilger, Bradley*

When the internet as a form of information delivery was popularized in the 1980s, there was very little in terms of standardization of content display. This, coupled with very limited layout and design options made for a very disorganized and “messy” web experience. In response to this, Dave Raggett helped to standardize the `<table>` tag to create predictable layout grids for HTML web pages. This led to a series of important changes in the practice of webpage design and layout. Many usability specialists (Jakob Nielsen among them) helped to refine the standards of web page layout and content structure. CSS began to rise and was deeply influenced by the use of `<table>` as a layout tool for predictability in design. CSS afforded many new possibilities for web pages to focus on type the way printed material did, but it undermined HTML tables’ “one-size-fits-all” appeal of browser rendering predictability. CSS now allows for grid-based design in much the same way that `<table>` once did, but Digger calls for a new “grid 2.0” envisioning of the table-based design principles that retains the designer and information-centric values of the `<table>` tag.

###The future of layout with CSS: Grid Layouts
*Brosset, Patrick*

Grids have been used (in coding and design practice) to control the layout of web pages for some time now. They are a set of “invisible horizontal and vertical lines” used to envision layout and position elements on a web page. They create display and navigational structure for the user. Until recently, CSS had very limited layout control, but it is now getting support for new properties that will allow designers to define grids for their web pages. Since the grid is defined purely in CSS, the layout and positioning of elements is completely separated from the HTML markup files, meaning that layout may be easily altered without confusing the HTML. This also has implications for responsive web design, as repositioning elements in rows and columns becomes much easier at differing viewport widths. While many responsive grid design solutions have been delivered to designers with toolkits such as Bootstrap, these toolkits are merely clever “tricks” and usages of existing properties to achieve the desired effect. These toolkits have helped to define the up-and-coming CSS Grid Layout specifications and proper implementation of web page grids.

##Connections:

There is an infinite web of connections to be made among all four articles (many of which have already been made by my peers), so I will choose to narrow the scope of my analysis a little bit: The articles can be separated into two categories: the over-arching, widely applicable scholarly articles that examine studies in culture, society, history, change, and the implications of technologies (Keim, Haas); and the contemporary, web-centric informative articles targeting only specific modern web technologies—in this case, the history of the `<table>` tag and CSS grids (Dilger, Brosset). Obviously, connections exist within these two categories (the Keim to the Haas, and the Dilger to the Brosset), but I would like to focus on the connections between the larger categories themselves: the implications of technological change and “old vs. new” technologies; and the history of table grids and the upcoming CSS grid properties.

The former grouping of articles discusses technologies themselves and how they change and progress; and also how the change of these technologies can be linked to society, culture, and individual practice and norms. Interestingly, this serves as a kind of “bridge” between two of the technologies discussed in the latter group: HTML tables, and the new CSS grid property.

Haas discusses the nonlinearity of technological change as a function of the progression of society, and asserts that so-called “older” technologies are not inherently any less powerful or useful than their “newer” counterparts (Haas 220-221). This idea is illustrated in the Dilger when the author discusses the prevalence of the use of `<table>` even after the advent of CSS with much more flexibility in styling and formatting; since CSS was so “new” and fresh, there were many inconsistencies among the browsers’ rendering of pages, and therefore many designers still relied on tables for consistent, predictable layout needs (Dilger 221). This eventually led to further “standardization” and “protocol” involving web standards and CSS development, wherein CSS gained many attributes that came directly from `<table>`. Many of these new changes are evident in the Brosset, where the author explains how CSS is now being used with the purpose of laying out pages and grids. And even so, this is not yet standardized and few browsers support it yet. This is an excellent example of how “new” technologies develop from old ones; but not because of linear progress. They develop because of a cultural shift and how individual practice calls for the change. This shows how a technology, even if it has evolved into a “newer” form, is not necessarily obsolete or without use; but that it may coexist with the new technology and may even supplement or provide benefits over the newer tech.

As Keim argues regarding handwriting compared with keyboarding, there may even be some important advantages to using “old” technologies over newer ones. For example, the use of tables in the late 90s into the early 2000s, while considered an “outdated” practice, offered designers more stability and predictability. Dilger, at the end of his article, calls for new standards that open up the rigid implementation of the “outdated” technologies that rethinks the grid, but that retains the value that characterizes its heritage. I think this is a similar sentiment to Keim’s argument for the importance of handwriting in conjunction with digital literacy; while digital communication is an excellent delivery method and certainly the way of the modern communicator and for the future of content delivery, it is important to return to the “roots” of written communication and develop the cognitive, mental, and physical skills that handwriting delivers. While digital literacy and communication may be the evolved form of handwriting, there is still value in handwriting and it should be replaced with newer digital technologies; it should continue to coexist with keyboard writing and be reincarnated alongside it.
