#Historicizing Conceptual Invention Workshop: A Generative Procedure

##Write-It-Out Workshop Prompts

**1. Currently, what is your historicizing project's main problem / aim? What broader social dynamics or issues are linked to your mediational means and its use or development over time?**

CSS media queries (and RWD in general) are not simply a new "fad" or design experiment; rather, they are a collective response to issues of accessibility across media types of all shapes and sizes: desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, screens of different resolutions, different capabilities, etc. There are more modes of access than any developer can account for, and properly designed media queries are a way to combat this uncertainty. It's an issue that has been addressed since the very beginnings of CSS and web page layout. It touches on deeper contentions of designer control over layout and presentation; the web has evolved into a new medium that deviates from print whence it came. The larger picture includes issues of new and old technology and divergent modes of information design and delivery.

**2.What conceptual tools will direct / guide your inquiry and analysis?**

* 2a. Haas' consideration of the Bijkerian theory of sociotechnical change, particularly the element of contingency and constraint, is the idea that change, as it is influcenced by cultural and societal conversation, is *contingent* on human design decisions and is *constrained* external factors such as social standards and the medium by which it manifests.
* 2b. CSS media queries went through a twisted conversation and a considerable revison process before they were finally approved in 2012. Their implementation was contingent mainly upon the decisions of H W Lie and his team, and constrained by current web standards conceptual models and the capabilities of modern browser technology.
* 2c. It's not so much an "adaptation" as it is a "mapping" of the theoretical definition of C/C onto a (sort of) modern issue. We have to accept that media queries, and any other form of web tech meant to solve a problem or bring about technological advancement, is the "product of social constructs and human design decisions" (Haas).

**3. Write about the link between your project's aims and your conceptual tools. What relationship do you see between them and why? How do the conceptual tools aid your analysis? Your aim?**

Using C/C to address the larger problems faced in web communications for the past twenty years acknowledges that there is no linearity or definite, decisive solution to these problems. We have to address the external factors in the situation (that is the human design decisions that have led the development of CSS and media queries, as well as the understanding to that point of print mediums) in order to understand the development of media queries. C/C sets up the social/cultural situation that surrounded the contentious issues of designer control and the way that the web was divergent from print mediums.

**4b. Based on what you wrote in #3, reread your historicizing project and take copious notes about weaknesses in your project. What areas could be addressed in more detail? What new implications or connections warrant more attention?**

* Intro should set out to define the problem _now_ and then relate it back to its historical roots. Focus less on the details of today, and more on how today's status reflects a larger issue that's been in conversation for some time now.
* In the section that details the particulars about media queries, ask questions about how and why they are the way they are; talk about the time frame that the addressed aspects were implemented or approved. Talk about the problems that these aspects address and why.
    * provide some documentation or links to the CSS proposals that outline media queries and their applications
* begin the rhetorical reframe with a nod to the situation at hand to help set context for the explaination of C/C
* The "putting it together" section should be integrated with the historical analysis part. Each section should be addressed and the analysis should discuss how these events led to the next, and why they are examples of sociotechnical change and their implications.
* general note: add more of the inline footnotes throughout
